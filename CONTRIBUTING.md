if the contribution involves any major changes, such as making a new module. Bug fixes and contributions
relating to already exisiting and approved issues are welcome without making a prior issue.

Please keep in mind that the goal of this project is to teach begginers. Therefore, please ensure that
everything you make is as simple and as straight-forward as possible; moreover, make sure to document everything,
and have proper javadocs for every method (except for simple methods such as getters/setters).

3. When writing a pull request, make sure you include referances to every issue you handled in your commits. Also, ensure
that your request contains a detailed description on all the changes you made. Examples of good descriptions are "Added self damage check

## Documentation

If you feel like something is missing from the documentation, open an issue for it. Once it is approved, feel free to write the wiki page yourself.
Make sure to not use any advanced terminology a begginer wouldn't understand.

If you want add translations to a page, feel free to do so without making an issue beforehand. Only translate if you are fluent in both languages.
